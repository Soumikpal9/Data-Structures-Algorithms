Problem Description

Given three positive integers A, B and C.

Any positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either B or C.

Return the Ath magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.



Problem Constraints

1 <= A <= 109

2 <= B, C <= 40000



Input Format

The first argument given is an integer A.

The second argument given is an integer B.

The third argument given is an integer C.



Output Format

Return the Ath magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = 1
 B = 2
 C = 3
Input 2:

 A = 4
 B = 2
 C = 3


Example Output

Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 6



Solution Approach => 

                    1. Brute Force => We can iterate from min(a, b) to min(a, b)*n and find the total
                        multiples at every step and check if the count matches n. Return that element
                        where the count matches n.

                        Time Complexity = O(N*min(a, b))
                        Space Complexity = O(1)

                    2. Optimised => We can use the same concept of binary search and use the conditions
                        accordingly in the same search space and we it will be reduced by that.

                        Time Complexity = O(log(N*min(a, b)))
                        Space Complexity = O(1)
