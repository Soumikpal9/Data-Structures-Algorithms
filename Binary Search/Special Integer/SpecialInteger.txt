Problem Description

Given an array of integers A and an integer B, find and return the maximum value K such that there is no subarray in A of size K with sum of elements greater than B.



Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 100000
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

1 <= B <= 10^9



Input Format

Example Input

Input 1:

A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = 10
Input 2:

A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
B = 130


Example Output

Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 3



Solution Approach => 

                    1. Brute Force => With the help of sliding window, iterate through 1 to max subarray
                        length and find where the condition is breaking.

                        Time Complexity = O(N^2)
                        Space Complexity = O(1)

                    2. Optimised => We can take the help of binary search in finding the K integer.
                        We can search in 1 to max subarray length and then find mid and use that mid
                        to reduce our search space as if all subarrays of length mid have a sum<=B.
                        If yes then update vour ans as mid and ignore the left part and else ignore
                        the right part. We can use sliding window to find the sum of the subarrays.

                        Time Complexity = O(NlogN)
                        Space Complexity = O(1)
