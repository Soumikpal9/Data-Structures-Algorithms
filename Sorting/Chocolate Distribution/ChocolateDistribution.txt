Problem Description

Given an array A of N integers where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet.

i-th can have A[i] number of chocolates.

There are B number students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets following below conditions:

1. Each student gets one packet.
2. The difference between the number of chocolates in packet with maximum chocolates and packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.
Return the minimum difference (that can be achieved) between maximum and minimum number of chocolates distributed.



Problem Constraints

0 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^7
0 <= B <= 10^5


Input Format

The first argument contains an integer array A.

The second argument contains an integer B.



Output Format

Return the minimum difference (that can be achieved) between maximum and minimum number of chocolates distributed.


Example Input

Input:

  A : [3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12]
  B : 5


Example Output

Output:

  6



Solution Approach => 

                    As we have to take the difference between the minimum and maximum for each of the 
                    students and return the minimum out of it, hence we need to maintain the minimum from 
                    all these students cases. So basically we need to sort the array and maintain a subarray
                    of the size as number of students in which we will keep the difference between the first
                    and last element of the subarray and keep on updating the minimum of them.


Complexity Analysis => 

                    Time Complexity = O(NlogN)

                    Space Complexity = O(1)
