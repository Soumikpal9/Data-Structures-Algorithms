Problem Description

Find the Bth smallest element in given array A .

NOTE: Users should try to solve it in <= B swaps.



Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 100000

1 <= B <= min(|A|, 500)

1 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format

First argument is vector A.

Second argument is integer B.



Output Format

Return the Bth smallest element in given array.



Example Input

Input 1:

A = [2, 1, 4, 3, 2]
B = 3
Input 2:

A = [1, 2]
B = 2


Example Output

Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 2


 Solution approach => 

                    Sort the array and find the Kth element from the start.

Complexity Analysis => 

                    Time Complexity = O(NlogN)

                    Space Complexity = O(1)
