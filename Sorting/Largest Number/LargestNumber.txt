Problem Description

Given a array A of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.



Problem Constraints

1 <= len(A) <= 100000
0 <= A[i] <= 2*109



Input Format

First argument is an array of integers.



Output Format

Return a string representing the largest number.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 3, 9, 0]


Example Output

Output 1:

 "9534330"
Output 2:

 "9320"



 Solution Approach => 

                1. Convert the int array into a string array.

                2. Use a comparator function to sort the array acc to your logic.

                3. Logic => we need to find 34 > 30 which can be also written as "3"+"4" > "3"+"0"
                    when the elements are in string.

                4. Return the string after sorting.

                5. Edge case => If all the elements are 0, then our string will return something like 
                    this "000000" instead we need to return only one 0.


Complexity Analysis => 

                    Time Complexity = O(NlogN)

                    Space Complexity = O(N)
