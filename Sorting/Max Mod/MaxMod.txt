Problem Description

Given an array A of size N, groot wants you to pick 2 indices i and j such that

1 <= i, j <= N
A[i] % A[j] is maximum among all possible pairs of (i, j).
Help Groot in finding the maximum value of A[i] % A[j] for some i, j.



Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 100000
0 <= A[i] <= 100000



Input Format

First and only argument in an integer array A.



Output Format

Return an integer denoting the maximum value of A[i] % A[j] for any valid i, j.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 44, 3]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 6, 4]


Example Output

Output 1:

 3
Output 2:

 4



 Solution Approach => 

                    We need to find the max A[i] % A[j]. So for that max A[i] % A[j] will happen
                    only when the 2nd largest element is mod with the largest. So we can directly
                    return the 2nd largest element.

                    Sort the array and return 2nd largest element.

Complexity Analysis => 

                    Time Complexity = O(NlogN)

                    Space Complexity = O(1)
