Problem Description

Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B and A as one sorted array and return it as an output.



Problem Constraints

-1010 <= A[i],B[i] <= 1010



Input Format

First Argument is a 1-D array representing A.

Second Argument is also a 1-D array representing B.



Output Format

Return a 1-D vector which you got after merging A and B.



Example Input

Input 1:

A = [4, 7, 9 ]
B = [2 ,11, 19 ]
Input 2:

A = [1]
B = [2]


Example Output

Output 1:

[2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 19]
Output 2:

[1, 2]t




Solution Approach =>

                    Take 2 pointers, each at the starting of the 2 arrays and iterate through the
                    arrays and compare each of the elements A[i] & A[j], whichever is smaller, 
                    put it in the new array.


Complexity Analysis =>

                    Time Complexity = O(N)

                    Space Complexity = O(N)
