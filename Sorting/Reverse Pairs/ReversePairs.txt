Problem Description

Given an array of integers A, we call (i, j) an important reverse pair if i < j and A[i] > 2*A[j].
Return the number of important reverse pairs in the given array A.



Problem Constraints

1 <= length of the array <= 105

-2 * 109 <= A[i] <= 2 * 109



Input Format

The only argument given is the integer array A.



Output Format

Return the number of important reverse pairs in the given array A.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [1, 3, 2, 3, 1]
Input 2:

 A = [4, 1, 2]


Example Output

Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 1



Solution Approach => 

                    1. Brute Force => Find all the pairs which satisfy the condition and return the count.

                        Time Complexity = O(N^2)
                        Space Complexity = O(1)

                    2. Modified Merge Sort => We can use merge sort to divide the array into single pieces
                        and then start joining them from bottom up just like Inversion Count and while
                        sorting them back we need to keep a count of the number of pairs which are actually
                        satisfying the condition A[i] > 2*A[j] and return that.

                        Time Complexity = O(NlogN)
                        Space Complexity = O(N)
